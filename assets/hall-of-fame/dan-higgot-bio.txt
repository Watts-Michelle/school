Dan started working in theatre sound on Hurtwood's Christmas musical Copacabana, mentored by Jon Clarence, one of many industry practitioners who come in to work on Hurtwood's bigger shows. That summer Jon set Dan up on work experience, working on shows across the West End including We Will Rock You, Tonight’s The Night and The Lion King.
Having graduated from LIPA Dan went straight out to work on large scale touring shows. His first major tour was ‘The Producers’, where, as Number Two Sound, he often operated the desk, mixing the likes of Peter Kay and Joe Pasquale to thousands of people. In 2008 he spent nine months as the lone sound engineer on an international tour of Matthew Bourne’s Edward Scissorhands including the Sydney Opera House. He has also worked on a diverse variety of shows including Blue Man Group in the West End, Spyski for the Lyric Hammersmith and Been So Long at the Young Vic, working alongside Tony and Olivier award winning Sound Designer Paul Arditti.
Dan says "This is hopefully just the beginning of a long and exciting career. It has all been possible because Hurtwood gave me the opportunity to learn new skills and work alongside some of the best in the business. Taking that opportunity has set me on this path, and it is something I am very grateful for. The last few years have been a huge adventure, and long may it continue!"
